# -q is for quiet; actually run all the `compdef's saved before `compinit` call
# (`compinit' declares the `compdef' function, so it cannot be used until
# `compinit' is ran; Zinit solves this via intercepting the `compdef'-calls and
# storing them for later use with `zinit cdreplay')

# zinit cdreplay -q
